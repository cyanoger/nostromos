# Keylios Nostromos

This is a personal resource repo for ergonomic keyboard projects like Nijuni, Jorne, Corne and others.
This is an effort to solve design differences and offer some basic convenience features that cannot be found in existing split keyboard and macropad projects.
At this moment, only keyboards that I currently own or plan to get are considered. Also, left halves only.

WIP:
* Case for Nijuni

TODO:
* Offer a Blender (or other software) project for adaptable case designs.
* Design an ergonomic palmrest and angled base
* Consider making it modular
* Design ergonomic keycaps
* Conceal/Emphasize Type C connectors, Bluetooth switches, Reset buttons and TRS/TRRS jacks
* Dumbpad. Maybe other numpad-like things too.

Current workflow:
* Convert existing Gerbers into SVG
* Import SVG into Blender
* Curves to Mesh, Join, Merge by distance
* Clean up the mesh, unbevel if necessary, make face(s)
* Extract the basic design with modifiers (here be dragons)
* Export STL

List of currently supported keyboards:
* Nijuni

TBD
